# Spring Boot + Exception Handling

This example has been copyied from the following original tutorial:

[Spring Boot + Exception Handling (2022) Hello World Example](https://www.codeusingjava.com/boot/except)

The only change is just commenting the tests. That's all!

## Getting Started

Just clone this project and import it into Eclipse.

You can test it using Postman. Here you have the collection of requests I have tried:
* [Tests made with POSTMAN](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3446841/2s7ZE4LjJp) - Just import them in POSTMAN to use them.

Enjoy!!!

## Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
